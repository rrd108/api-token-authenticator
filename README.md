# CakePHP ApiTokenAuthenticator Plugin

A Simple Token Authentication Plugin for CakePHP 4 REST API-s.

For CakePHP 5 version see [rrd108/api-token-authenticator](https://github.com/rrd108/api-token-authenticator/)

## Configuration

### `Users` table

In your `users` table you should have a field named `token`, or whatever name you choose for the token. We will use `token` in the examples. The `token` value will not be automatically generated by the plugin. You can generate it in your `UsersController.php` file's `login()` method (or elsewhere if you want). See the example below.

### Changing the default settings

If you are happy with the default settings, you can skip this section.

For defaults see `config/apiTokenAuthenticator.php` file in the plugin's directory.

If you want to change any of the values then create your own `config/apiTokenAuthenticator.php` file at your project's `config` directory. In your config file, you should use _only_ those keys that you want to change. It will be merged to the default one. So, for example, if you are happy with all the options, except in your case the token's header name is `Authorization`, then you have to put this into your on config file.

```php
<?php
return [
  'ApiTokenAuthenticator' => [
    'header' => 'Authorization',
  ]
];
```

## Authentication

The plugin authentication workflow is the following.

At your client appliacation you should send a POST request to `/users/login.json` (or what you set in your `config/apiTokenAuthenticator.php` file) with a JSON object like this.

```json
{
  "email": "rrd@webmania.cc",
  "password": "rrd"
}
```

If the login was successful than you will get a response like this.

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "token": "yourSecretTokenComingFromTheDatabase"
  }
}
```

Than you can use this `token` to authenticate yourself for accessing urls what requires authentication. The `token` should be sent in a request header named `Token` (or what you set in your `config/apiTokenAuthenticator.php` file).

## Installation

### 1. Install the plugin

Including the plugin is pretty much as with every other CakePHP plugin:

```bash
composer require rrd108/api-token-authenticator:^0.4
```

Then, to load the plugin either run the following command:

```bash
bin/cake plugin load ApiTokenAuthenticator
```

or manually add the following line to your app's `src/Application.php` file's `bootstrap()` function:

```php
$this->addPlugin('ApiTokenAuthenticator');
```

### 2. Disable CSRF protection

You should comment out `CsrfProtectionMiddleware`.

### 3. Load the plugin's components

At your `AppController.php` file's `initialize()` function you should include these components:

```php
public function initialize(): void
{
    parent::initialize();
    $this->loadComponent('RequestHandler');
    $this->loadComponent('Authentication.Authentication');
}
```

### 4. Set password hasher

Update your `src/Model/Entity/User.php` file adding the following.

```php
use Authentication\PasswordHasher\DefaultPasswordHasher;
protected function _setPassword(string $password)
  {
    $hasher = new DefaultPasswordHasher();
    return $hasher->hash($password);
  }
```

### 5. Set extensions for `routes`

As you probably will use JSON urls, do not forget to add this lien to your `routes.php` file.

```php
$builder->setExtensions(['json']);
```

That's it. It should be up and running.

## The `login()` method

### If you use static `tokens`

Login method is not added automatically, you should implement it. Here is an example how.

```php
public function login()
{
    $result = $this->Authentication->getResult();
    if ($result->isValid()) {
        $userIdentity = $this->Authentication->getIdentity();
        $user = [
            'id' => $userIdentity->id,
            'token' => $userIdentity->token
        ];
        $this->set(compact('user'));
        $this->viewBuilder()->setOption('serialize', ['user']);
    }
}
```

### If you use dynamic `tokens`

```php
public function login()
{
    $result = $this->Authentication->getResult();
    if ($result->isValid()) {
        $userIdentity = $this->Authentication->getIdentity();

        $user = $userIdentity->getOriginalData();
        $user->token = $this->generateToken();
        $user = $this->Users->save($user);
        $user = $this->Users->get($user->id);

        $this->set(compact('user'));
        $this->viewBuilder()->setOption('serialize', ['user']);
    }
    // if login failed you can throw an exception, suggested: rrd108/cakephp-json-api-exception
}

private function generateToken(int $length = 36)
{
    $random = base64_encode(Security::randomBytes($length));
    $cleaned = preg_replace('/[^A-Za-z0-9]/', '', $random);
    return $cleaned;
}
```

## Token expiration

By default tokens are not invalidated by the plugin, you can use them permanently or as long as there is no new login session like in the example code above.

If you want the plugin to use tokens only for a certain period of time, you should do the following steps.

1. Add a column to your `users` table named `token_expiration` and set it's type to `datetime`. You can use a different field name, but you have to change it in the following steps.

2. In your `config/apiTokenAuthenticator.php` file set `'tokenExpiration' => 'token_expiration'`.

3. Update your `src/Model/Entity/User.php` file adding the field to the `$accessible` array.

```php
protected $_accessible = [
  'email' => true,
  // your other fields here
  'token' => true,
  'token_expiration' => true,
];
```

4. Update your `src/Model/Table/UsersTable.php` file adding the following.

```php
$validator
  ->dateTime('token_expiration')
  ->allowEmptyDateTime('token_expiration');
```

5. In your `src/Controller/UsersController.php` file you should modify `login()` method.

```php
public function login()
{
  $result = $this->Authentication->getResult();
  if ($result->isValid()) {
      $userIdentity = $this->Authentication->getIdentity();
      $user = $userIdentity->getOriginalData();
      list($user->token, $user->token_expiration) = $this->generateToken();
      $user = $this->Users->save($user);

      $this->set(compact('user'));
      $this->viewBuilder()->setOption('serialize', ['user']);

      // delete all expired tokens
      $this->Users->updateAll(
          ['token' => null, 'token_expiration' => null],
          ['token_expiration <' => Chronos::now()]
      );
  }
}

private function generateToken(int $length = 36, string $expiration = '+6 hours')
{
  $random = base64_encode(Security::randomBytes($length));
  $cleaned = preg_replace('/[^A-Za-z0-9]/', '', $random);
  return [$cleaned, strtotime($expiration)];
}
```

## Access without authentication

If you want to let the users to access a resource without authentication you should state it in the controller's `beforeFilter()` method. The `login`, `register` methods are good candidates to allow unauthenticated access.

```php
// For example in UsersController.php
public function beforeFilter(\Cake\Event\EventInterface $event)
{
  parent::beforeFilter($event);
  $this->Authentication->allowUnauthenticated(['login', 'index']);
}
```

This will allow users to access `/users.json` url without authentication.

# Migration

## Migration form version 0.1

Version 0.3 and 0.2 is totally backward compatible with version 0.1

By default, now we use CakePHP's default password hashing instead of `md5` as it was less secure.
Inspite of this your current users will be able to login with their current password, but if you want to use the more secure hasing for new users and keep old users as they are, you have to do the following.

1. Make sure in your database the password field is at least 60 characters long.

2. Update your `src/Model/Entity/User.php` file adding the following. By this whenever and old user with and `md5` hashed password updates his/her password it will be hashed with the default hashing algorythm.

```php
use Authentication\PasswordHasher\DefaultPasswordHasher;
protected function _setPassword(string $password)
  {
    $hasher = new DefaultPasswordHasher();
    return $hasher->hash($password);
  }
```

3. In your `config/apiTokenAuthenticator.php` file you should define this passwordHasher array.

```php
return [
  'ApiTokenAuthenticator' => [
    // any other custom settings
    // ...
      'passwordHasher' => [
        'className' => 'Authentication.Fallback',
        'hashers' => [
          'Authentication.Default', [
            'className' => 'Authentication.Legacy',
            'hashType' => 'md5',
            'salt' => false
          ],
        ]
    ]
  ]
];
```
